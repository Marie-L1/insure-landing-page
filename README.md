- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS extension
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
Although I didn't learn any new technologies from this project, I was able to reinforce and apply skills I've been practicing. Here's a breakdown:

- **React**: Used React for the project, which is my go-to for building user interfaces. It was a great opportunity to further develop my knowledge of React's component-based architecture and hooks.
  
- **TypeScript**: Although it wasn't necessary for the project, I decided to implement TypeScript for practice. It helped me better understand static typing and type safety in JavaScript, which is useful for scaling up projects.

- **Sass**: Sass remains my preferred CSS preprocessor, and I used it extensively to manage styles for this project. This allowed me to utilize features like nesting, variables, and mixins to make the styling process more efficient.

Overall, it was a great practice project for improving my React development workflow and gaining more confidence in using TypeScript and Sass together.
